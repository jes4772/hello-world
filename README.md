# hello-world
My first repository

I've been coding for over 10 years and have worked in numerous languages across all layers of the stack and worked in tiny start-ups to billion dollar international corporations.

I've worked with Delphi, C#, VB.Net, Java, SQL, SSRS, SSIS, HTMl, css, javascript.

My last 3 years has been dedicated to javascript, jQuery, jQuery UI, and jqPlot.
